# Practical React App

This project is a hands-on React + TypeScript application built as part of a practical course. It covers a wide range of modern React concepts, UI libraries, state management, and styling techniques. The project demonstrates both functional and class-based components, real-world UI scenarios, and persistent state using localStorage.

## Project Features & Topics Learned

### 1. React Fundamentals
- Functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Class-based components and their lifecycle
- Props and state management
- Controlled components for forms

### 2. TypeScript in React
- Using TypeScript with React components
- Defining types and interfaces for props and state

### 3. UI Libraries and Styling
- Material-UI (MUI): Buttons, TextField, theming (dark mode)
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first styling for rapid UI
- styled-components: Custom styled React components
- CSS modules and custom styles

### 4. Forms and Validation
- Login forms (functional and class-based)
- Controlled inputs for email/password
- Password masking and accessibility
- Form submission handling

### 5. State Persistence
- Using localStorage to save and retrieve user data (login info)

### 6. CRUD Operations
- Todo List: Add and delete todos, dynamic list rendering
- Component composition (TodoItem)

### 7. API Integration
- Fetching and displaying posts from an external API (jsonplaceholder)
- Pagination logic for large lists

### 8. Advanced React Patterns
- Conditional rendering
- Prop drilling and component composition
- Theming with ThemeProvider
- Responsive and accessible UI

### 9. Miscellaneous
- Custom and MUI Buttons
- Welcome message with dynamic props
- Cart component with dynamic item updates
